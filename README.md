# Rom Organizer

This is a program that uses No Intro database files to create an organized copy of a local romset. It can create merged sets (where a game folder is created containing all versions of a game that you own) or 1G1R sets (1 Game 1 Rom; each folder contains only the "best" version of a game; ideally, the latest non-demo/proto USA revision). Games are also sorted by primary region (e.g. if a USA version of a game exists, the game folder containing all versions will be placed in the USA folder).

This isn't very user-friendly or customizable; I only made it for my own personal use.
